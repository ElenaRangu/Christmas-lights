# Christmas-lights
Hardware components needed: Arduino Uno, BreadBoard, LEDs, Buzzer. By pressing the push button, the LEDs will light up in different patterns. Also, with the help of a buzzer, Christmas songs will be added. First of all, it begins with testing the LEDs and resistors, using as power source an USB cable plugged into a computer. In order to make it possible to turn the LEDs on and further using the buzzer, first the LEDs have to be put on the positions on the tree, then the wires have to be connected from the Arduino component in the breadboard, which is already linked with the resistors. After this, the connection should be like: Arduino -> Breadboard -> Resistors -> LEDs(interlinked with the wires).
